Impro is a thought-provoking book. Here are
some of my favourite sentences, taken out of context:

### Outlook

> I thought of myself as a late developer. Most people lose their
talent at puberty. I lost mine in my early twenties. I began to think
of children not as immature adults, but of adults as atrophied children.

> It was as if I had learned to redesign everything, to reshape
it so that I saw what _ought_ to be there, which of course is much
inferior to what _is_ there. The dullness was not an inevitable
consequence of age but of education.

> It is crazy to insist that one flower is especially beautiful.

> In one moment I knew that the valuing of men by their intelligence
is crazy, that the peasants watching the night sky might feel more
than I feel, that the who man dances might be superior to myself
word-bound and unable to dance.

> People may seem unimaginative, but they'll be extremely ingenious at
rationalising the things they do.

> The authors of the pseudo-plays assumed that writing should be based
on other writing, not on life.

> It's tautological to say that normal people are the most suggestible,
since it is because they're the most suggestible that they're the most
normal!

### Education

> Good and bad teachers are engaged in opposite activities.

> When I hear that children have an attention span of ten minutres,
or whatever, I'm amazed. Ten minutes is the attention span of _bored_
children.

> He'd found my class doing arithmetic with masks over their face.

> If the students fail they're to blame me... it's obvious that they should
blame me... I really will apologise to them when they fail, and ask them to
be patient with me, and explain that I am not perfect.

> I trained myself to share my eye contacts out among the group.

> I say 'Good' instead of 'That's enough'.

> Instead of seeing people as _untalented_, we can see them as _phobic_,
and this completely changes the teacher's relationship with them.

> You have to trick students into believing that content isn't important,
and that it looks after itself, or they never get anywhere.

> When it's their turn to take part they're to come out and just do what
they're asked to, and _see what happens_. It's this decision not to try and
control the future which allows the students to be spontaneous.

> The actors would suggest a way of doing something, and if they started
to explain, Brecht would say he wanted no discussion in rehearsal - it
would have to be tried.

> Making the student safe, and getting him to have confidence in you, are
essential. You then have to work together with the student, as if you were
both trying to alter the behaviour of some _third_ person. It's also important
that the student who succeeds at playing a status he feels to be alien should
be instantly rewarded, praised and admired. It's no use just giving the
exercises and _expecting_ them to work. You have to understand where the
resistance is and devise ways of getting it to crumble.

> It must be understood by the class that people are allowed to get upset,
and are not to be punished by being considered exhibitionist or cissy.

### Status

> We want people to be very low-status, but we don't want to feel sympathy
for them - slaves are always supposed to sing at their work.

> Visitors to zoos feel dominant when they can outstare the animals. I
suggest you try the opposite with zoo animals: break eye contact and then
glance back for a moment. Polar bears may suddenly see you as 'food'. Owls
cheer up perceptibly.

> The things _said_ are not as important as the status _played_.

> Status is played to anything, objects as well as people. If you enter an
empty waiting-room, you can play high or low status to the furniture.

> Once you can accept being insulted (the insult is the verbal eqivalent of
the custard pie), then you experience a great elation. The most rigid,
self-conscious, and defensive people suddenly unbend.

> The actor or improviser must accept his disabilities, and allow himself
to be insulted, or he'll never really feel _safe_.

> The interest we have in custard pies is in seeing them hit people.

> You can play high or low status in any situation.

### Research

> There's a great gap between what I would choose to write, and what
actually emerges.

> Look _back_ when you get stuck, instead of searching _forwards_. You
look for things you've shelved, and then reinclude them.

> The student hesitates not because he doesn't have an idea, but to conceal
the inappropriate ones that arrive uninvited.

> We distrust spontaneity, and try to replace it by reason.

> It's weird to wake up knowing you'll be onstage in twelve hours, and
there's absolutely nothing you can do to ensure success.

> I was so far away from anyone whose criticism I cared about that I felt
free to do exactly what I felt like. Suddenly I was spontaneous again;
and since then, I've always directed plays as if I was totally ignorant
about directing; I simply approach each problem on a basis of common sense
and try to find the most obvious solution possible.

> The crowd absolves you of the need to maintain your identity.

> One you understand the you're no longer held responsible for your actions,
then there is no need to maintain a 'personality'.

> We learn to hold characteristic expressions as a way of maintaining our
personaliities.

> When someone insist that they 'can't think up a story', they really mean
that they 'won't think up a story' - which is OK by me, so long as they
understand that it's a refusal, rather than a 'lack of talent'.

> Striving after originality takes you far away from your true self, and makes
your work mediocre.

> If an improviser is stuck for an idea, he shouldn't search for one, he
should trigger his partner's ability to give 'unthought' answers.
