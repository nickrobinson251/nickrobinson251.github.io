Here are some of my favourite sentences, taken out of context:</p> <h3 id=outlook ><a href="#outlook">Outlook</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>I thought of myself as a late developer. Most people lose their</p> </blockquote> <p>talent at puberty. I lost mine in my early twenties. I began to think of children not as immature adults, but of adults as atrophied children.</p> <blockquote> <p>It was as if I had learned to redesign everything, to reshape</p> </blockquote> <p>it so that I saw what <em>ought</em> to be there, which of course is much inferior to what <em>is</em> there. The dullness was not an inevitable consequence of age but of education.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is crazy to insist that one flower is especially beautiful.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In one moment I knew that the valuing of men by their intelligence</p> </blockquote> <p>is crazy, that the peasants watching the night sky might feel more than I feel, that the who man dances might be superior to myself word-bound and unable to dance.</p> <blockquote> <p>People may seem unimaginative, but they&#39;ll be extremely ingenious at</p> </blockquote> <p>rationalising the things they do.</p> <blockquote> <p>The authors of the pseudo-plays assumed that writing should be based</p> </blockquote> <p>on other writing, not on life.</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#39;s tautological to say that normal people are the most suggestible,</p> </blockquote> <p>since it is because they&#39;re the most suggestible that they&#39;re the most normal&#33;</p> <h3 id=education ><a href="#education">Education</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>Good and bad teachers are engaged in opposite activities.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>When I hear that children have an attention span of ten minutres,</p> </blockquote> <p>or whatever, I&#39;m amazed. Ten minutes is the attention span of <em>bored</em> children.</p> <blockquote> <p>He&#39;d found my class doing arithmetic with masks over their face.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>If the students fail they&#39;re to blame me... it&#39;s obvious that they should</p> </blockquote> <p>blame me... I really will apologise to them when they fail, and ask them to be patient with me, and explain that I am not perfect.</p> <blockquote> <p>I trained myself to share my eye contacts out among the group.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I say &#39;Good&#39; instead of &#39;That&#39;s enough&#39;.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Instead of seeing people as <em>untalented</em>, we can see them as <em>phobic</em>,</p> </blockquote> <p>and this completely changes the teacher&#39;s relationship with them.</p> <blockquote> <p>You have to trick students into believing that content isn&#39;t important,</p> </blockquote> <p>and that it looks after itself, or they never get anywhere.</p> <blockquote> <p>When it&#39;s their turn to take part they&#39;re to come out and just do what</p> </blockquote> <p>they&#39;re asked to, and <em>see what happens</em>. It&#39;s this decision not to try and control the future which allows the students to be spontaneous.</p> <blockquote> <p>The actors would suggest a way of doing something, and if they started</p> </blockquote> <p>to explain, Brecht would say he wanted no discussion in rehearsal - it would have to be tried.</p> <blockquote> <p>Making the student safe, and getting him to have confidence in you, are</p> </blockquote> <p>essential. You then have to work together with the student, as if you were both trying to alter the behaviour of some <em>third</em> person. It&#39;s also important that the student who succeeds at playing a status he feels to be alien should be instantly rewarded, praised and admired. It&#39;s no use just giving the exercises and <em>expecting</em> them to work. You have to understand where the resistance is and devise ways of getting it to crumble.</p> <blockquote> <p>It must be understood by the class that people are allowed to get upset,</p> </blockquote> <p>and are not to be punished by being considered exhibitionist or cissy.</p> <h3 id=status ><a href="#status">Status</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>We want people to be very low-status, but we don&#39;t want to feel sympathy</p> </blockquote> <p>for them - slaves are always supposed to sing at their work.</p> <blockquote> <p>Visitors to zoos feel dominant when they can outstare the animals. I</p> </blockquote> <p>suggest you try the opposite with zoo animals: break eye contact and then glance back for a moment. Polar bears may suddenly see you as &#39;food&#39;. Owls cheer up perceptibly.</p> <blockquote> <p>The things <em>said</em> are not as important as the status <em>played</em>.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Status is played to anything, objects as well as people. If you enter an</p> </blockquote> <p>empty waiting-room, you can play high or low status to the furniture.</p> <blockquote> <p>Once you can accept being insulted &#40;the insult is the verbal eqivalent of</p> </blockquote> <p>the custard pie&#41;, then you experience a great elation. The most rigid, self-conscious, and defensive people suddenly unbend.</p> <blockquote> <p>The actor or improviser must accept his disabilities, and allow himself</p> </blockquote> <p>to be insulted, or he&#39;ll never really feel <em>safe</em>.</p> <blockquote> <p>The interest we have in custard pies is in seeing them hit people.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>You can play high or low status in any situation.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id=research ><a href="#research">Research</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>There&#39;s a great gap between what I would choose to write, and what</p> </blockquote> <p>actually emerges.</p> <blockquote> <p>Look <em>back</em> when you get stuck, instead of searching <em>forwards</em>. You</p> </blockquote> <p>look for things you&#39;ve shelved, and then reinclude them.</p> <blockquote> <p>The student hesitates not because he doesn&#39;t have an idea, but to conceal</p> </blockquote> <p>the inappropriate ones that arrive uninvited.</p> <blockquote> <p>We distrust spontaneity, and try to replace it by reason.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It&#39;s weird to wake up knowing you&#39;ll be onstage in twelve hours, and</p> </blockquote> <p>there&#39;s absolutely nothing you can do to ensure success.</p> <blockquote> <p>I was so far away from anyone whose criticism I cared about that I felt</p> </blockquote> <p>free to do exactly what I felt like. Suddenly I was spontaneous again; and since then, I&#39;ve always directed plays as if I was totally ignorant about directing; I simply approach each problem on a basis of common sense and try to find the most obvious solution possible.</p> <blockquote> <p>The crowd absolves you of the need to maintain your identity.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>One you understand the you&#39;re no longer held responsible for your actions,</p> </blockquote> <p>then there is no need to maintain a &#39;personality&#39;.</p> <blockquote> <p>We learn to hold characteristic expressions as a way of maintaining our</p> </blockquote> <p>personaliities.</p> <blockquote> <p>When someone insist that they &#39;can&#39;t think up a story&#39;, they really mean</p> </blockquote> <p>that they &#39;won&#39;t think up a story&#39; - which is OK by me, so long as they understand that it&#39;s a refusal, rather than a &#39;lack of talent&#39;.</p> <blockquote> <p>Striving after originality takes you far away from your true self, and makes</p> </blockquote> <p>your work mediocre.</p> <blockquote> <p>If an improviser is stuck for an idea, he shouldn&#39;t search for one, he</p> </blockquote> <p>should trigger his partner&#39;s ability to give &#39;unthought&#39; answers.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > 2017-09-17 &copy; Nick Robinson. </div> </div> </div><!doctype html> </div> </div> <div class=page__footer > <footer> <div class=page__footer-follow > <ul class=social-icons > <li><a href="https://nickrobinson251.github.io/feed.xml" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa fa-rss" aria-hidden=true ></i> RSS Feed</a> </ul> </div> <div class=page__footer-copyright >&copy; Nick Robinson.
