I'm a research software engineer, mostly writing code in [Julia](julialang.org), and contributing to open-source software when I can.

I made this little site to practise writing, because I admire people who write well.
Right now I'm mostly writing for myself.

The site's theme comes from something a former boss said to me:

> People, ideas, machines - in that order.

I think he was misquoting [a military strategist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)).
Anyway, he was reminding me to focus more on people skills than technical skills.
People are important, and the only way we solve hard problems is by working together and having good ideas.
