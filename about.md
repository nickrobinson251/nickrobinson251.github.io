I'm studying AI and trying to figure out how to be a useful person. I made this little site to practise writing because I admire people who write well. Right now I'm mostly writing for myself, so this is basically my diary. Welcome!

The site name comes from something my former boss said to me. 

> People, ideas, machines - in that order.

I think he was misquoting [a military strategist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)). Anyway, he was reminding me to focus more on people skills than technical skills. People are important, and the only way we solve hard problems is by working together and having good ideas.
